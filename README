Generic long poll server used by Launchpad and Landscape.


Building
--------

lazr.amqp needs a recent RabbitMQ with support for rejection. Maverick's
1.8.0 is not sufficient, but 2.1.1 works fine, so >= Natty is OK.

 $ python bootstrap.py
 $ bin/buildout


Testing
-------

The test suite needs some users and vhosts on the system RabbitMQ
instance.

 $ ./rabbitmq-test-setup
 $ bin/test
